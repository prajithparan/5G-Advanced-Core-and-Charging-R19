// HTTP/2 client built on libcurl (which already has mature native HTTP/2 support), used for all
// outbound SBI calls (NF -> NRF, NF -> NF). Synchronous/blocking per call -- see docs/DECISIONS.md
// ADR-0006 for why that's an acceptable Phase 0 simplification and what integrating it with the
// Boost.Asio event loop (curl_multi + asio) would take later.
//
// TLS 1.3 + mTLS only (see ADR-0011): every request presents the client's own certificate and
// verifies the server's against the configured CA. There is no cleartext fallback -- pass a `url`
// with anything other than an https:// scheme and the request fails.
//
// Thread-safety: `send()` is safe to call concurrently from any number of threads. libcurl's own
// contract is explicit that one easy handle must never be driven by two threads at once, so each
// concurrent call gets its OWN easy handle, checked out of an internal pool.
//
// Why this exists at all (ADR-0050 Stage 5): every NF's convention had been "one Client instance
// per thread", so the single-handle design was never exercised concurrently until that stage's
// detached per-report thread design gave `nfs/smf`'s `chf_report_client` a second, genuinely
// concurrent caller -- caught via a real, live, malformed-response failure (`curl_easy_perform`
// returning `CURLE_FAILED_INIT`/empty responses under real concurrent access), not by inspection.
// The original fix serialized every caller on one mutex held across `curl_easy_perform`, which was
// correct but made every outbound SBI call queue behind every other one on the same Client.
//
// ADR-0241 replaced that with the handle pool: the mutex is now held only for the pool
// checkout/checkin (microseconds), never across the blocking network round-trip. Handle REUSE is
// preserved deliberately -- a checked-in handle keeps its live connection, TLS session cache and
// DNS cache, which is what makes HTTP/2 connection keepalive real, so the pool hands back the same
// handles rather than creating fresh ones per call.
//
// Lifetime contract (pre-existing, stated here rather than newly introduced): a Client must
// outlive every in-flight `send()` call on it. Destroying one while another thread is inside
// `send()` was already undefined with the single-handle design (the destructor never took the
// mutex either); every NF holds its Clients for process lifetime, which is why this has never
// bitten. See ADR-0241 for full disclosure.
