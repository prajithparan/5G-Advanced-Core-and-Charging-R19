# Architecture Decision Records

Format: one entry per decision, in the order made. Rejected alternatives are recorded, not deleted,
per CLAUDE.md's working-style rules. See also `CLAUDE.md`'s "Project decisions (resolved at
kickoff)" section for the kickoff-time answers this log expands on.

## ADR-0001: Greenfield build, no fork of Open5GS or free5GC

**Date:** 2026-08-04
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** PROMPT.md Section 2 flags build-vs-fork as the decision most likely to dominate this
project's economics, and asks for a build-vs-fork analysis as a first deliverable.

**Decision:** Build greenfield. Open5GS (C) and free5GC (Go) remain reference reading only.

**Rejected alternative:** Fork or structurally borrow from Open5GS/free5GC. Rejected per explicit
user instruction ("Greenfield from scratch"), given without requesting the comparative analysis
first.

**Consequence:** No shortcut on control-plane procedure implementations later; everything is
generated from the R19 YAML or hand-written against the spec text, per the source-of-truth rule.

---

## ADR-0002: Public repository, Apache-2.0 license

**Date:** 2026-08-04
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Brief mandates open source; hosting/license choice was left open.

**Decision:** Public GitHub repository, Apache-2.0.

**Rejected alternatives:**
- MIT: simpler but no explicit patent grant, which matters more here given likely corporate
  forks/contributors in a standards-adjacent project.
- AGPL-3.0: copyleft network-use clause is a poor fit for a reference implementation meant to be
  forked and embedded freely.

---

## ADR-0003: GoogleTest + gMock as the primary test framework

**Date:** 2026-08-04
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Mandated stack lists both GoogleTest and Catch2 without specifying which is primary.

**Decision:** GoogleTest + gMock for unit and integration tests (natural pairing; gMock only works
with GoogleTest).

**Rejected alternative:** Catch2 as primary. No strong reason against it, but GoogleTest + gMock's
mocking integration is more valuable given how much of this codebase is SBI clients/servers that
will want mocked peers in unit tests. Catch2 was initially left in the vcpkg manifest for later
BDD-style use, then dropped during Task 8 (build validation) because its vcpkg port needs
`pkg-config`, which isn't installed and nothing yet uses Catch2 -- re-add when a real test wants
it rather than carrying an unused dependency.

---

## ADR-0004: Hand-rolled HTTP/2 server on raw nghttp2 + Boost.Asio

**Date:** 2026-08-04
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** The mandated stack lists "nghttp2 (core), Boost.Beast or Pistache for the service
layer." In practice: vcpkg's `nghttp2` port builds only the core C library, not upstream's bundled
`asio_http2` ("nghttp2-asio") convenience wrapper -- it isn't packaged at all. Neither Boost.Beast
(HTTP/1.1 + WebSocket only) nor Pistache (HTTP/1.1 only) implement HTTP/2. Since the non-negotiable
rules require "100% of SBI traffic is HTTP/2," something has to actually speak the protocol.

**Decision:** `libs/sbi-core`'s `http2::Server` drives nghttp2's raw C session API
(`nghttp2_session_server_new`, `nghttp2_session_mem_recv`/`mem_send`, header/frame/data callbacks)
directly, with Boost.Asio supplying the TCP accept/read/write loop. See
`libs/sbi-core/src/http2_server.cpp`.

**Rejected alternative:** Add Drogon (MIT, in vcpkg, has built-in HTTP/2 support) as the server
framework. Would have cut implementation effort significantly, but deviates from the brief's
mandated stack without being asked for; user chose the raw-nghttp2 path specifically to avoid an
undisclosed dependency substitution.

**Consequence:** More code to review and maintain than a framework would need, and it's the
highest-risk hand-written piece in Phase 0 -- stream lifecycle and flow-control bugs here would be
subtle. Flagged explicitly for extra scrutiny during build/test (see PHASE0-NOTES below).

---

## ADR-0005: h2c (cleartext) only for Phase 0, no TLS/mTLS yet

**Date:** 2026-08-04
**Status:** Superseded by ADR-0011 (2026-08-04) -- real TLS 1.3 + mTLS is now in place.

**Context:** The non-negotiable rules mandate OpenSSL 3.x with TLS 1.3 and mTLS for real SBI
traffic. Standing up a lab PKI (CA, per-NF certs, mTLS validation) is real scope on its own and
wasn't needed to prove Phase 0's actual goal: that the hand-rolled HTTP/2 transport and OAuth2 flow
work end-to-end.

**Decision:** `http2::Server` and `http2::Client` speak h2c (HTTP/2 cleartext, "prior knowledge")
only. hello-nf <-> stub-nrf runs entirely over plaintext TCP.

**Consequence -- explicitly non-conformant:** This is a real gap against TS 33.501 and the
non-negotiable rules, not a hidden one. It must be closed with real TLS 1.3 + mTLS (ALPN
negotiating "h2") before any NF-to-NF traffic beyond the Phase 0 stub is considered done. Tracked
as follow-up work for Phase 2.

---

## ADR-0006: Synchronous libcurl calls for the HTTP/2 client (Phase 0)

**Date:** 2026-08-04
**Status:** Accepted (temporary)

**Context:** libcurl's easy interface is blocking by default; integrating it with Boost.Asio's
event loop properly means driving `curl_multi_socket_action` from Asio's reactor.

**Decision:** `http2::Client::send()` blocks the calling thread via `curl_easy_perform`. Fine for
hello-nf, which has nothing else to do while waiting.

**Consequence:** Not viable for a real NF handling concurrent inbound SBI requests while also
making outbound calls -- that would stall the server's io_context if called from the same thread.
Revisit (curl_multi + Asio integration, or a dedicated client thread pool) before any Phase 2 NF
needs to make outbound calls while serving inbound ones.

---

## ADR-0007: ProblemDetails/InvalidParam hand-written in sbi-core, not generated

**Date:** 2026-08-04
**Status:** Accepted (disclosed, deliberate exception to "never hand-write a DTO")

**Context:** `sbi-core` (Phase 0) is itself a dependency of `tools/sbi-codegen` (Phase 1) -- there
is no codegen pipeline yet to generate anything from. But `ProblemDetails` (TS 29.500 clause 5.2.7
generic error handling) is needed by sbi-core's own server/client error paths.

**Decision:** `sbi_core::ProblemDetails` and `sbi_core::InvalidParam` are hand-written in
`libs/sbi-core/include/sbi_core/problem_details.hpp`, with every field name transcribed verbatim
from `specs/5G_APIs-REL-19/TS29571_CommonData.yaml` (commit `bca84b6`, lines 518-559 and 615-630).
Three fields that reference other files' schemas (`accessTokenError`, `accessTokenRequest`,
`noProfileMatchInfo`) are carried as opaque `nlohmann::json` rather than fully modeled, since fully
modeling them would mean also generating the NRF access-token/discovery schemas early.

**Consequence:** Once Phase 1's codegen exists, generated NF code should depend on and reuse
`sbi_core::ProblemDetails` rather than regenerating a second copy from `CommonData.yaml` --
otherwise there would be two competing definitions of the same wire type.

---

## ADR-0008: CI split into build / sanitize / lint jobs on free GitHub-hosted runners

**Date:** 2026-08-04
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** User chose free-tier CI compute (no self-hosted runners) and small-increment cadence.

**Decision:** Three jobs: `build` (plain Debug build + ctest), `sanitize` (matrix: ASan+UBSan vs.
TSan, kept as two separate configs since they're mutually exclusive at compile time), `lint`
(clang-format --dry-run, clang-tidy). vcpkg binary caching via `actions/cache` to keep runtimes
reasonable on the free tier.

**Rejected alternative:** A libFuzzer job. Deferred -- there's no codec worth fuzzing yet; the
first real target is the PFCP codec in Phase 3.

---

## ADR-0009: Target raised from lab-grade to production-grade

**Date:** 2026-08-04
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** PROMPT.md Section 2 and CLAUDE.md's original goal statement both scoped this project
as "lab-grade... not a carrier-grade core," and CLAUDE.md's own Reality Check section still says
so. The user edited CLAUDE.md's goal line to "production-grade" and, when the resulting
inconsistency (production-grade goal vs. still-lab-grade Reality Check, vs. PROMPT.md's original
framing) was flagged per CLAUDE.md's own "if this file and PROMPT.md disagree, treat that as a
bug" rule, confirmed the change is deliberate: the real target is production-grade, not lab-grade.

**Decision:** The project's quality bar is raised to production-grade. CLAUDE.md's Reality Check
section is updated to match (see that section's amended text) rather than left contradicting the
goal statement.

**Immediate consequence -- work already built must be revisited:**
- **ADR-0005 (h2c only, no TLS/mTLS)** was justified as "an acceptable Phase 0 lab
  simplification." Under a production-grade bar it is not acceptable as a final state -- real
  TLS 1.3 + mTLS (per TS 33.501 and the non-negotiable engineering rules) must be added before
  Phase 2 NFs talk to anything beyond the throwaway stub-nrf. Not fixed in this ADR; tracked as
  required follow-up, first candidate being before/during Phase 2's NRF work since NRF is the
  trust anchor every other NF's OAuth2 flow depends on.
- **stub-nrf's unsigned, fake OAuth2 token** similarly stops being acceptable once real NFs need
  to validate tokens against it -- the real NRF (Phase 2) must issue and NFs must validate
  properly signed JWTs.
- **ADR-0006 (synchronous libcurl client)** and the ~40 outstanding `clang-tidy` style warnings
  noted in PHASE0-NOTES below become real technical debt against a production bar, not
  acceptable-forever lab shortcuts. Not urgent individually, but should not accumulate further
  without a plan to close them.
- Every future phase's Definition of Done should be read as production-grade from here forward:
  full TS 23.502 procedure coverage (not "mandatory only" read loosely), real conformance testing,
  and no silent gaps -- consistent with CLAUDE.md's existing "flag stubs/simplifications honestly"
  rule, which does not change, only the bar for what's an acceptable *permanent* state does.

**Rejected alternative:** Revert CLAUDE.md's goal line back to "lab-grade" to match PROMPT.md and
avoid the rework above. Rejected -- user explicitly confirmed production-grade is the intended
target after the conflict was surfaced.

**Note:** PROMPT.md itself is left unedited as the historical record of the original brief;
CLAUDE.md is the living document and is what future sessions should treat as authoritative on this
point going forward.

## ADR-0010: Custom Jinja2 generator for `tools/sbi-codegen`, not openapi-generator

**Date:** 2026-08-04
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Phase 1 requires evaluating openapi-generator's C++ targets against a custom Jinja
generator on three pilot files (`TS29510_Nnrf_NFManagement.yaml`, `TS29518_Namf_Communication.yaml`,
`TS29571_CommonData.yaml`) and recommending one with evidence. Correction to PROMPT.md's own text:
current openapi-generator has no `cpp-restsdk` *server* target -- `cpp-restsdk` is client-only.
Available C++ server targets: `cpp-httplib-server`, `cpp-oatpp-server`, `cpp-pistache-server`,
`cpp-qt-qhttpengine-server`, `cpp-restbed-server`(-deprecated). `cpp-pistache-server` was used as
openapi-generator's representative since PROMPT.md named Pistache explicitly.

**Framework HTTP/2 support (checked, not assumed):** none of Pistache, cpp-httplib, restbed, or
oatpp advertise HTTP/2 in their vcpkg port descriptions, and this matches their known designs
(Pistache, cpp-httplib, restbed are HTTP/1.1-only by construction). This reinforces ADR-0004: no
openapi-generator C++ server target can replace `libs/sbi-core`'s hand-rolled HTTP/2 server, so
codegen server/route scaffolding is out of scope regardless of which model-generation approach
wins -- only the DTO/serializer layer is a real candidate for adoption.

**openapi-generator model output -- concrete defects found by actually compiling it:**
1. **anyOf-open-enum (3GPP's pervasive `anyOf: [{enum:[...]}, {type: string}]` pattern, e.g.
   `NFType`, `NFStatus`) generates a completely empty class.** `NFType.h`/`.cpp` from
   `cpp-pistache-server` has no data member; `to_json` emits `{}`; and `operator==`'s body is a bare
   `return;` in a `bool`-returning function -- **confirmed with `g++ -std=c++20 -fsyntax-only`: this
   does not compile** (`error: return-statement with no value, in function returning 'bool'`). This
   pattern covers dozens of types across the R19 API surface, not an edge case.
2. **Pattern/format constraints are silently dropped.** `Fqdn`'s regex pattern
   (`TS29571_CommonData.yaml`) and `Ipv6Addr`'s `allOf`-combined patterns have zero enforcement in
   generated code -- `grep -rl "std::regex" model/` finds regex usage only in the generator's own
   hardcoded RFC 3339 date/date-time helper, nowhere else.
3. **Cross-file `$ref` duplication.** Generating `TS29510_Nnrf_NFManagement.yaml` and
   `TS29518_Namf_Communication.yaml` independently (as real per-NF codegen invocations would)
   produces 84 duplicate files (42 types x .h+.cpp) for shared `TS29571_CommonData.yaml`-derived
   types (`PlmnId`, `Guami`, `InvalidParam`, `AccessTokenReq`, ...) -- an ODR risk if ever linked
   together, and definite drift risk if maintained per-NF.
4. No `discriminator:` usage exists in the three pilot files (checked, not assumed absent) --
   openapi-generator's polymorphism handling was not evaluated since there is nothing to evaluate
   it against here.
5. `nullable` fields use an `...IsSet` boolean-flag pattern rather than `std::optional`, which is
   functional (not a defect), just a different convention than this project's `std::optional`-based
   `sbi_core::put_optional`/`get_optional` helpers already in use in `libs/sbi-core`.

**Decision:** Build `tools/sbi-codegen` as a custom Python + Jinja2 generator
(`tools/sbi-codegen/`), not a wrapper around openapi-generator. It:
- Resolves `$ref` (internal and cross-file) into a single schema registry so a shared type (e.g.
  `Guami`) is generated exactly once regardless of how many pilot/NF files reference it, eliminating
  defect #3 above.
- Represents the anyOf-open-enum pattern as a plain-`std::string`-backed struct with named
  `static inline const std::string` constants for known values -- any value (known or not)
  round-trips correctly, fixing defect #1. Proven in `tests/conformance/test_round_trip.cpp`
  (`NFTypeUnknownValueRoundTrips`) with a value that is not in the known-enum list.
  See `libs/sbi-core/include/sbi_core/sbi_headers.hpp`.
- Enforces `pattern` (direct or `allOf`-combined) via a generated `validate_<Type>(const
  std::string&)` using `std::regex`, fixing defect #2. Proven in `tests/conformance/test_round_trip.cpp`
  (`AmfIdPatternValidation`) with both an accepted and a rejected value.
- Uses `std::optional<T>` for `nullable`/non-required fields via the existing
  `sbi_core::put_optional`/`get_optional` helpers (`json_serde.hpp`), collapsing the
  absent-vs-explicit-null distinction into one state -- a disclosed simplification (most real-world
  OpenAPI-to-C++ generators do the same; a true tri-state would need
  `std::optional<std::optional<T>>` or an explicit sentinel, not worth the complexity for a Phase 1
  prototype).
- Falls back to `using Name = nlohmann::json;` (opaque passthrough) for schema shapes not
  confidently modeled (inline-composed properties, non-string enums, unrecognized `allOf` member
  shapes) rather than guessing. Across the full transitive closure of the three pilot files (1076
  types, 22 source YAML files pulled in transitively -- 3GPP's own schemas are far more
  interconnected than "three pilot files" suggests), **114 types (10.6%) are opaque fallbacks**;
  the rest (583 objects, 193 aliases, 186 open-enums) are fully typed. This ratio is reported
  honestly, not hidden.

**A genuine structural finding, not a codegen bug:** the three pilot files' transitive `$ref`
closure forms one large strongly-connected component spanning 22 of the 33 initially-encountered
source files (`TS29571_CommonData.yaml` <-> `TS29510_Nnrf_AccessToken.yaml` <->
`TS29520_Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription.yaml` <-> ... ). A first, naive one-header-per-source-file version
of this generator hit real "not declared in this scope" compile errors from `#pragma once` silently
no-op'ing a re-entrant `#include` before the needed type was defined -- a genuine circular
C++-header dependency caused by a genuine circular schema dependency in 3GPP's own YAML, not
something either generator invented. Fixed by computing strongly-connected components (Tarjan's
algorithm, `render.py`) over the file dependency graph and emitting **one merged header per SCC**,
with types topologically sorted *within* the merged group by field-level dependency. Result: 11
output file-groups instead of 33, one of which (`TS29122_CommonData_grp.hpp`) is a 546KB file
covering all 22 mutually-dependent source files with a citation block listing all of them.
**Trade-off, disclosed:** this means a change to any one of those 22 files' schemas forces
recompilation of everything in the merged group -- acceptable for a Phase 1 prototype proving
feasibility, but worth revisiting (e.g. finer-grained per-type headers with forward declarations
where the field is used via reference/pointer) if build-time incrementality becomes a real pain
point once more NFs are generated in Phase 2+.

**Four more real bugs found only by actually compiling the generated output** (not by inspection --
each was caught by `g++ -fsyntax-only` on the real generated files, then fixed and re-verified):
- Multi-line 3GPP YAML descriptions (common -- long prose paragraphs with embedded quotes and
  clause references like "3GPP TS 23.003") only had their first line `//`-commented; subsequent
  lines leaked as raw uncommented text into the file. Fixed with a `cppcomment` Jinja filter that
  prefixes every line.
- JSON field names that legitimately start with a digit (`5qi`, `5gMmCapability` -- real 5G QoS
  Identifier field names) are invalid C++ identifiers. Fixed with an `n`-prefix shim
  (`_cpp_field_name`) that only affects the emitted C++ member name, not the JSON wire name.
- The same issue for *type* names (`5GDdnmfInfo`, `2G3GLocationArea` are real schema names), plus
  `and`/`or`/`not`/etc. (C++'s alternative-operator keywords, easy to forget) colliding with real
  field names. Fixed with a shared `cpp_type_name`/reserved-word sanitizer applied consistently at
  both a type's declaration and every reference to it.
- A field whose name is identical to its own type's name (e.g. field `Snssai` of type `Snssai`,
  observed in `SmallDataRateStatusInfo`) compiles but triggers `-Wchanges-meaning` and genuinely
  breaks subsequent name lookup within the same struct once GCC's strict mode is considered. Fixed
  by appending `_` to a field name when it collides with its own bare type name.

**Rejected alternative:** Use openapi-generator for the model/DTO layer specifically (since server
scaffolding was already ruled out by the HTTP/2 finding above), patching its Mustache templates to
fix the anyOf-open-enum bug. Rejected: openapi-generator is a Java tool with its own template
release cadence; maintaining a fork of its templates long-term is a comparable or larger maintenance
burden than owning a ~600-line Python generator we already have full visibility and control over,
and the duplication problem (defect #3) is architectural to openapi-generator's per-invocation model
generation, not fixable via template patches alone.

**Consequence:** `tools/sbi-codegen/generate.py` is wired into the CMake build
(`libs/sbi-generated/CMakeLists.txt`) as a configure-time + rebuild-time step (re-runs when the
generator, its templates, or the pilot YAML change; adding/removing a pilot file needs a
re-configure for `file(GLOB)` to notice new output files -- a known, disclosed CMake limitation of
globbing dynamically generated sources). Requires `python3` with `jinja2`/`pyyaml` on `PATH` --
**not** vcpkg-managed, since there is no vcpkg C++ substitute for a Python code generator; CI
installs these explicitly. This generator's ~10.6% opaque-fallback rate and disclosed
nullable-collapsing simplification are expected to shrink incrementally as Phase 2+ NF work
surfaces schema shapes not yet handled -- it is deliberately not attempting to be a complete,
general-purpose OpenAPI-to-C++ compiler on day one.

## ADR-0011: Real TLS 1.3 + mTLS, closing ADR-0005's gap

**Date:** 2026-08-04
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** ADR-0009 raised the project's target to production-grade, which made ADR-0005's h2c-
only transport explicitly unacceptable as a permanent state, and the user confirmed TLS/mTLS must
land before Phase 2's NRF work starts (not retrofitted after).

**Decision:**
- **Lab PKI**: `scripts/gen-lab-pki.sh` generates a self-signed root CA and one leaf cert per NF
  (EC P-256/prime256v1, SHA-256, 365-day validity), each with **both** `serverAuth` and
  `clientAuth` EKU since every NF is simultaneously an SBI server and client. SAN covers
  `127.0.0.1`/`localhost`/the NF's own name. Output to `certs/` at repo root (gitignored --
  regenerable dev material, not secrets worth version-controlling); the script itself is
  committed.
- **`http2::Server`**: the accepted TCP socket is wrapped in `boost::asio::ssl::stream`, using an
  `ssl::context::tlsv13_server` context (method-table-level restriction to TLS 1.3, not just an
  option flag). Loads the NF's cert+key, sets `verify_peer | verify_fail_if_no_peer_cert` against
  the configured CA (real mTLS enforcement), and installs an ALPN select callback
  (`SSL_CTX_set_alpn_select_cb` + `SSL_select_next_proto`) that accepts only `h2` --
  `SSL_TLSEXT_ERR_ALERT_FATAL` on anything else, no HTTP/1.1 or no-protocol fallback.
  `TlsConfig{cert_path, key_path, ca_path}` (shared with the client, `tls_config.hpp`) is a
  required constructor argument, not optional/defaulted -- a caller cannot construct an
  unauthenticated or unencrypted `Server` by omission; the constructor throws if any path is
  missing or the material fails to load.
- **`http2::Client`**: almost entirely libcurl configuration -- `CURLOPT_SSLVERSION` pinned to
  `CURL_SSLVERSION_TLSv1_3`, `CURLOPT_SSLCERT`/`SSLKEY` (client cert for mTLS),
  `CURLOPT_CAINFO` (verify server), `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER`/`VERIFYHOST` left on. HTTP version
  switched from `CURL_HTTP_VERSION_2_PRIOR_KNOWLEDGE` (h2c) to `CURL_HTTP_VERSION_2TLS` (ALPN-
  negotiated over TLS).
- **stub-nrf/hello-nf**: both load their own cert/key + the shared CA (paths baked in at compile
  time via `CERTS_DIR` -- see below), URLs switched to `https://`.

**Proof, not assertion:**
- `openssl s_client -connect 127.0.0.1:7777 -alpn h2 -tls1_3 -CAfile certs/ca/ca.crt` **without**
  a client cert: server sends `tlsv13 alert certificate required` -- mTLS is actually enforced,
  not just configured and silently unchecked.
- Same command **with** `-cert certs/hello-nf/cert.pem -key certs/hello-nf/key.pem`: succeeds,
  `New, TLSv1.3, Cipher is TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`, `ALPN protocol: h2`, `Verify return code: 0
  (ok)`.
- `tests/integration/test_hello_nf_registration.cpp` (real subprocess-to-subprocess, not mocked)
  passes: hello-nf obtains an OAuth2 token, registers (201), heartbeats (200), deregisters (204),
  all over the real TLS 1.3 + mTLS handshake above.

**Disclosed simplifications / known gaps, not hidden:**
- **No graceful TLS shutdown**: `Connection::close()` closes the underlying TCP socket directly
  rather than performing `async_shutdown` (TLS `close_notify`). A fully correct version needs its
  own timeout handling to avoid an unresponsive peer leaking the connection indefinitely; that
  timeout machinery wasn't built. Every current `close()` call site is a teardown/error path, not
  a graceful reuse handoff, so the practical impact today is limited -- but this is real,
  disclosed debt, not fixed.
- **Cert paths are compile-time absolute paths** (`CERTS_DIR` baked in via
  `target_compile_definitions` from `CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR`), not a runtime config system. Acceptable
  for dev/lab binaries run in-place; will need real config (env vars, a config file, whatever
  Phase 2's NF config story ends up being) once these aren't just Phase 0 throwaways.
- **No cert rotation/revocation** (no CRL/OCSP checking, no rotation tooling) -- single static lab
  CA and leaf certs, regenerate-and-restart is the only "rotation" story right now.
- **stub-nrf's OAuth2 token is still unsigned** (ADR-0009 already flagged this separately) --
  TLS/mTLS secures the transport; it doesn't address token signature validation, which is
  unrelated and still Phase 2 NRF work.

**Rejected alternative:** Defer TLS/mTLS until Phase 2, retrofitting it once NRF exists. Rejected
per explicit user decision when the sequencing question was asked directly -- TLS/mTLS first so
Phase 2 starts on solid transport rather than needing a retrofit across whatever NF code lands in
the meantime.

**Note:** the "over actual h2c HTTP/2" phrasing in ADR-0008's PHASE0-NOTES appendix below describes
the Phase 0 build-validation run at the time it was written and is left as a historical record, not
updated to match current behavior -- the transport it describes has since changed per this ADR.

## ADR-0012: jwt-cpp + ES256 for NRF's OAuth2 token issuance/verification

**Date:** 2026-08-05
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** `TS29510_Nnrf_AccessToken.yaml`'s `AccessTokenClaims` schema (lines 361-406) requires
`iss`, `sub`, `aud`, `scope`, `exp` -- real signed JWTs, not stub-nrf's Phase 0 unsigned placeholder
(ADR-0009 already flagged that as needing to close). Needed: a JWS/JWT library.

**Decision:** `jwt-cpp` (header-only, MIT, vcpkg-available, uses OpenSSL under the hood -- no new
crypto backend). Algorithm: ES256 (ECDSA P-256), not RS256. The lab PKI
(`scripts/gen-lab-pki.sh`) already generates P-256 keys for every NF's mTLS cert, so ES256 keeps
the codebase to one curve/algorithm family instead of two; EC keys are also smaller and faster to
verify than RSA at an equivalent security level. NRF's JWT signing keypair
(`certs/nrf-jwt/{private,public}.pem`) is generated separately from any NF's mTLS transport
cert -- reusing a transport key for JOSE signing mixes usages that real PKI practice (and
TS 33.501) keeps apart.

**Verification (not just chosen, checked to work):** a standalone round-trip test
(issue -> verify valid, issue -> tamper one byte -> verify rejects with "invalid signature", issue
-> verify against a Verifier expecting a different issuer -> rejects with "claim value does not
match expected value") passed before this was wired into NRF's request handlers. Re-verified live
against the running NRF over the real TLS+mTLS transport: a request with `Authorization: Bearer
<token>tampered` gets a real 401 with `ProblemDetails{"detail":"invalid signature", ...}`, not a
silent accept.

**Rejected alternative:** RS256. No functional reason against it, but see above -- would have
added a second key type/algorithm family to the codebase for no benefit over ES256 in a lab
context with no interop requirement forcing RSA specifically.

**Consequence:** `sbi_core::jwt::Verifier` lives in `libs/sbi-core` (not `nfs/nrf`), specifically
because every future NF needs to verify incoming bearer tokens NRF issued, not just NRF itself --
NRF only needs the `Issuer` side.

## ADR-0013: Prometheus metrics via opentelemetry-cpp's own exporter, not a separate prometheus-cpp dependency

**Date:** 2026-08-05
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** CLAUDE.md's Definition of Done requires "OpenTelemetry spans + Prometheus metrics
emitted" per NF. Tracing (spans) already exists via opentelemetry-cpp (`otel.hpp`, Phase 0).
Metrics export does not exist yet anywhere in the project.

**Decision:** Enable opentelemetry-cpp's `prometheus` vcpkg feature
(`opentelemetry-cpp[prometheus]`) rather than adding `prometheus-cpp` as an independent top-level
dependency. `libs/sbi-core/include/sbi_core/metrics.hpp` mirrors `otel.hpp`'s shape
(`init_metrics(bind_address)` / `get_meter(name)`). Pull model: `PrometheusExporterFactory`
starts a small HTTP listener (civetweb, bundled transitively) that Prometheus scrapes directly at
`/metrics` -- no push/collector step, unlike the OTLP tracing path.

**Rejected alternative:** `prometheus-cpp` directly. It's what opentelemetry-cpp's Prometheus
feature uses internally anyway (visible in the vcpkg dependency resolution:
`prometheus-cpp[compression,core,pull]` gets pulled in transitively) -- depending on it directly
would mean two ways to create/register metrics in the same codebase (raw prometheus-cpp registry
API vs. the OTel Meter API already used for consistency with tracing) for no benefit.

**Verification:** NRF exposes `nrf_registrations_total`, `nrf_deregistrations_total`,
`nrf_heartbeats_total`, `nrf_tokens_issued_total` (counters) and `nrf_registered_nf_count` (an
`ObservableGauge` reading the live registry size via callback). Confirmed live:
`curl http://127.0.0.1:9464/metrics` returns real Prometheus text-format output with
`nrf_registered_nf_count{otel_scope_name="nrf"} 0` visible before any registration.

**API note for future NFs using this:** `opentelemetry::metrics::Counter<T>`/`ObservableInstrument`
are only forward-declared in `meter.h` (used for the `Meter` interface's return types); a caller
needs `#include <opentelemetry/metrics/sync_instruments.h>`,
`<opentelemetry/metrics/async_instruments.h>`, and `<opentelemetry/metrics/observer_result.h>`
directly to get complete types before calling `->Add(...)` or `->AddCallback(...)` -- otherwise it
fails to compile with "invalid use of incomplete type". `metrics.hpp` already pulls these in so
callers of `sbi_core::get_meter()` don't hit this themselves.

## ADR-0014: NRF Docker image -- Ubuntu 24.04 multi-stage, PKI generated at container start

**Date:** 2026-08-05
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** No NF has been containerized before this (Phase 0's binaries were throwaways, never
built a Dockerfile). `nfs/nrf/CMakeLists.txt` bakes `CERTS_DIR` in as a compile-time absolute path
(`${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/certs`, an already-disclosed Phase 0/ADR-0011 simplification) -- this has a
direct, concrete consequence for how the image has to be built.

**Decision:** `deploy/docker/nrf.Dockerfile`, multi-stage: `builder` (Ubuntu 24.04, full build
toolchain + vcpkg + codegen Python deps, builds the `nrf` target only -- `-D5GC_BUILD_TESTS=OFF`),
`runtime` (Ubuntu 24.04 + `openssl`/`ca-certificates` only, copies the built binary). Both stages
use `/build` as `WORKDIR` specifically so the compile-time `CERTS_DIR` path resolves at runtime
too. The entrypoint runs `scripts/gen-lab-pki.sh nrf` fresh on every container start (ephemeral
CA/certs per container instance by default -- consistent with this being a lab image, not a
provisioned deployment).

**Real build issues hit and fixed, not just anticipated:**
- Docker build context initially copied the host's `build/` directory (stale `CMakeCache.txt`
  pointing at the host's absolute path) -- CMake correctly refused to reuse it inside the
  container. Fixed with `.dockerignore` excluding `build/`, `build-*/`, `certs/`, `.git/`, etc.
- `git clone --depth 1` for vcpkg inside the Dockerfile failed vcpkg's own baseline resolution:
  `vcpkg.json`'s `builtin-baseline` pins a specific historical commit, but a shallow clone only
  fetches the current tip of the default branch, which does not contain that commit object. Fixed
  with a full clone + explicit `git checkout <pinned-commit>`.

**Verification:** actually built (`docker build -f deploy/docker/nrf.Dockerfile -t 5gc-nrf:test .`)
and ran in this environment, not just written-but-unverified Dockerfile text -- see
`docs/TRACEABILITY.md` for the concrete command/output this ADR's claims are backed by.

**Rejected alternative:** a distroless or Alpine runtime base for a smaller image. Rejected for
now on time/complexity grounds (musl vs. glibc ABI concerns with the vcpkg-built static libs
weren't worth resolving for a first Docker pass); worth revisiting once image size actually
matters for the lab.

**Disclosed gap:** no non-root `USER` directive yet -- the container currently runs as root. Real
gap against container-security best practice, not fixed in this pass; flagged rather than silently
shipped as if it were fine.

## ADR-0015: NRF-specific simplifications (in-memory storage, partial discovery/subscription semantics)

**Date:** 2026-08-05
**Status:** Accepted (disclosed, tracked)

Consolidates the Phase 2 NRF-specific gaps that don't warrant their own ADR individually but need
to be findable in one place rather than scattered only as code comments:

- **In-memory storage only** (`nfs/nrf/src/registry.hpp`'s `NfRegistry`/`SubscriptionRegistry`),
  no persistence across restarts. A restart loses every registered NF and subscription; every NF
  would need to re-register (which real NFs do periodically via heartbeat anyway, so this is a
  softer gap than it sounds for NFs already running, but a hard one for anything mid-flight during
  a restart).
- **`SearchNFInstances` filters on `target-nf-type` only.** `TS29510_Nnrf_NFDiscovery.yaml`'s real
  query parameter set is much larger (service-names, snssais, dnn, requester-nf-instance-fqdn,
  ...); only the one mandatory discriminating parameter needed for a single-NRF lab to be useful
  is implemented. Real per CLAUDE.md's source-of-truth rule -- not a fabricated subset, a
  disclosed incomplete one.
- **Subscription notification fan-out ignores `subscrCond`.** `SubscriptionData.subscrCond` is a
  real, conditionally-typed filter (which NF types/events a subscriber cares about); this
  implementation delivers every `NF_REGISTERED`/`NF_PROFILE_CHANGED`/`NF_DEREGISTERED` event to
  every active subscriber regardless of what they actually asked for.
- **Notification delivery is synchronous best-effort** (log a warning on failure, no retry) --
  consistent with ADR-0006's synchronous HTTP/2 client; a slow or unreachable subscriber blocks
  the NRF request that triggered the notification for the duration of that one delivery attempt.
- **`GetNFInstances` (list-all) has no pagination** -- `TS29510_Nnrf_NFManagement.yaml` doesn't
  mandate it for this operation, but a very large registry would return an unbounded response
  body; not a problem at lab scale, flagged for whenever it might become one.
- **`/shared-data*` (multi-NRF federation) and `/scp-domain-routing-info*` (SCP-specific) are not
  implemented at all** -- explicitly out of scope for this pass per the agreed procedure list, not
  silently dropped from consideration. No second NRF instance exists in this lab and SCP isn't
  built yet, so neither is exercisable regardless.

## PHASE0-NOTES: build validation outcome

Resolved during the "build and run locally" pass (2026-08-04), g++ 13.3 / vcpkg baseline
`f1d4bbc7`, against the actual installed package versions:

- **nghttp2 C API** (nghttp2 1.69.0): the classic API written against
  (`nghttp2_session_mem_recv`/`mem_send`, `nghttp2_data_provider`, `nghttp2_submit_response`)
  compiled and ran correctly as-is -- no `*2`/`nghttp2_ssize` migration needed.
- **nghttp2 CMake integration**: wrong on the first attempt. vcpkg's `nghttp2` port ships only a
  pkg-config file (`libnghttp2.pc`), not a CMake config -- `find_package(nghttp2 CONFIG REQUIRED)`
  / `nghttp2::nghttp2` do not exist. Fixed to `pkg_check_modules(nghttp2 REQUIRED IMPORTED_TARGET
  libnghttp2)` / `PkgConfig::nghttp2` in `libs/sbi-core/CMakeLists.txt`. See ADR-0004.
- **OpenTelemetry C++ SDK** (opentelemetry-cpp 1.28.0): header paths and factory API
  (`TracerProviderFactory`, `OtlpHttpExporterFactory`, `OStreamSpanExporterFactory`,
  `SimpleSpanProcessorFactory`/`BatchSpanProcessorFactory`) were correct as written. One real bug:
  constructing `opentelemetry::nostd::shared_ptr<TracerProvider>` directly from the
  `std::unique_ptr` returned by `TracerProviderFactory::Create` is ambiguous (two applicable
  constructor overloads). Fixed in `otel.cpp` by routing through an intermediate
  `std::shared_ptr<TracerProvider>` first.
- **Other vcpkg CMake target names** used in `libs/sbi-core/CMakeLists.txt` --
  `opentelemetry-cpp::trace`, `opentelemetry-cpp::ostream_span_exporter`,
  `opentelemetry-cpp::otlp_http_exporter`, `tl::expected`, `nlohmann_json::nlohmann_json`,
  `spdlog::spdlog`, `CURL::libcurl`, `Boost::system` -- all resolved correctly, no changes needed.
- **vcpkg manifest**: `catch2` and (transitively) `openssl` need `pkg-config` on the build host to
  compile from source; wasn't installed initially. `catch2` was dropped from the manifest instead
  (unused -- see amended ADR-0003); `pkg-config` was installed for `openssl`, which is a real
  dependency and couldn't be dropped.
- **Result**: full build green (`sbi_core`, `stub-nrf`, `hello-nf`, `integration_tests`), the
  `tests/integration` GoogleTest suite passes, and a manual run confirms the real behaviour: hello-nf
  obtains an OAuth2 token, registers (HTTP 201), heartbeats (HTTP 200), deregisters (HTTP 204), all
  over actual h2c HTTP/2 through the hand-rolled nghttp2 server, with OTel spans emitted for the
  register/heartbeat steps.
- **Not yet clean**: `clang-tidy` (now runnable locally, clang-18 installed) reports ~40 style-only
  warnings across the hand-written files -- `readability-identifier-length` (short names like `ms`,
  `it`, `pd`), `misc-include-cleaner` (missing direct includes for transitively-available symbols),
  `misc-const-correctness`, one `google-build-using-namespace`, one `bugprone-exception-escape` on
  each `main()` (no top-level try/catch around the NF lifecycle). None are errors --
  `WarningsAsErrors` is empty and CI's lint job won't fail on them -- but they're real, undone
  cleanup, not silently ignored. Left for an incremental pass rather than gold-plating Phase 0
  further before Phase 1 starts.
