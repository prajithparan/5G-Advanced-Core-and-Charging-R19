// ADR-0281 (P4.12): chaos tests against the money path.
//
// P4.12's wording: "chaos tests (kill a node mid-session, partition the balance store) asserting
// no double-charge and no lost usage". Both scenarios are here, driven against real processes over
// real HTTP/2 + mTLS -- not simulated failures inside one process.
//
// What "no double-charge, no lost usage" can actually mean in this system, stated precisely so the
// assertions are not read as broader than they are:
//
//   - no LOST usage  = a charging session that existed before a hard kill is still chargeable
//                      afterwards. CHF's ChargingDataStore is Redis-backed (ADR-0055 onward), so a
//                      killed CHF must come back able to Update the same ChargingDataRef.
//   - no DOUBLE      = the operations that move money are not repeatable. A Release must succeed
//                      once and 404 on a repeat, and an unknown ref must 404 rather than being
//                      silently created as a second session.
//   - partitioned    = when the balance store is unreachable, CHF must not record a reservation it
//     balance store    could not make. `reserve_subscriber_balance` returning false must mean no
//                      `add_reserved`, not a granted quota with no money behind it.
